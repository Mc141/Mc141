## About Me

I’m M.C. Wolmarans, a third-year Bachelor of Computing student at Belgium Campus, majoring in Software Engineering. I was honored to be the valedictorian for both my first and second academic years, reflecting my dedication and academic excellence.

I have a strong foundation in C#, Python, JavaScript, Java, and full-stack development, with experience across ASP.NET MVC, Node.js, React, SQL Server, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL. Passionate about building scalable, practical software solutions, I’m continuously expanding my skills with modern frameworks and technologies.

I also have a growing interest in the ethical development and usage of AI. By studying theology and philosophy in my free time, I aim to integrate these perspectives with my software expertise in the future.
